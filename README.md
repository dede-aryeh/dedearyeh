## 💻 Technical Background
Before starting my MS in Biostatistics, I worked as a **Software Development Consultant in Fintech**.  
- Designed, built, and maintained RESTful APIs and relational databases.  
- Developed responsive front-end interfaces using Angular.  
- Applied computational and data-driven approaches to solve product problems and automate workflows.

These engineering experiences strengthen my biostatistics work by enabling reproducible analyses and production-ready data solutions.
