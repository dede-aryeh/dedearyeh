I’m an MS Biostatistics student with a background in pharmacy and software development. I’m passionate about applying statistical methods and data science to develop reproducible, data-driven solutions that improve healthcare outcomes. I’m particularly interested in clinical trials and biomedical informatics — with growing interest in predictive modeling and reproducible health data analyses.

## 💻 Technical Background
Before starting my MS in Biostatistics, I worked as a **Software Development Consultant in Fintech**.  
- Designed, built, and maintained RESTful APIs and relational databases.  
- Developed responsive front-end interfaces using Angular.  
- Applied computational and data-driven approaches to solve product problems and automate workflows.

These engineering experiences strengthen my biostatistics work by enabling reproducible analyses and production-ready data solutions.
